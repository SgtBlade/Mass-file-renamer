# Mass-file-renamer
Mass rename files of series so that mediaservers like Plex have an easier time recognising the episodes

## Warning
I did not make this foolproof as it is just something I quickly made. Test it before using it on your episodes.

## This tool is supposed to be used together with tampermonkey
[The script](https://github.com/SgtBlade/Mass-file-renamer/blob/790efe857748896271079c159acaf88e33fe1d72/Episode%20names.user.js)
Using tampermonkey I made a script that outputs the episodes of a series on the season page to a list that you can easily copy and then paste inside the tool.

For example, going to this link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/episodes?season=1 outputs the list:
Game of Thrones - S01E01 - Winter Is Coming
Game of Thrones - S01E02 - The Kingsroad
Game of Thrones - S01E03 - Lord Snow
....

You select this list and paste it within the tool in the New Episodes window




## How to use the tool:

### 1. Paste the new episode names in the window
You can also write them yourself but using the script mentioned above is easier

### 2. Select the folder of the episodes (GetPath button)

### 3. Change the season if required

### 4. Change the filenames
